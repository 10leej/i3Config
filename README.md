# Welcome to the Pretty Branch

This branch is just a work-in-progress, and will probably be abandoned, but you never know. It's based on settings and files (reset to very old commit hash) I used something like 2 years ago, and back then I still used bars. I had two bars showing lots of cool information. Some of it's broken now, but other parts still work. I'm going to tinker with it to see what I can come up with.

I find myself often missing my very old setups, because they were functional yet very attractive, or so I found. I look back at my old screenshots with fondness and nostalgia, missing the settings which once were, so I'm trying to bring some of them back, and to allow you guys to use them as well. Obviously, once I've got stuff working, I'll start refactoring the code, because a good portion of it isn't so great.
