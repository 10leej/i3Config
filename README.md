# Introduction to i3Config

My dedicated [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org) (now [i3-gaps](https://github.com/AirBlader/i3)) setup \- which I've used and tweaked for ~7 years \- is part of the pride and joy of any of my Linux installations. It's a very clean, minimalistic approach to window management, without the hand-holding of the default i3-wm configuration. You are assumed to be familiar with this tiling window manager.

Included, are several handy scripts for i3(-gaps):

  * **comp_toggle** - _Easily toggle compton/picom on or off._
  * **font_cycle** - _Cycle between multiple pre-set alacritty(1) fonts._
  * **key_autorepeat** - _Toggle keyboard autorepeat \- challenge your Vim!_
  * **lockscreen** - _Simple but presentable lockscreen helper for i3lock(1)_
  * **partmount** - _Easily toggle-mount filesystems with udisksctl(1)_
  * **shooter** - _Easily take screen-, window-, or select-shots with scrot(1)_
  * **term_font_size** - _Globally adjust alacritty(1) or xfce4-terminal(1) font sizes_

Note to mention several scripts for PulseAudio users. Easily and intelligently adjust sink and source volumes. Toggle the loopback device with a simple script. Switch sinks with ease, such as between monitor speakers and headphones.

# Have Some Questions?

You might have some questions, so here, I'll attempt a pre-emptive strike:

  **Q: Why float by default?**\
  A: New, non-configured windows are useable, instead of a huge mess.

  **Q: What's wrong with modes?**\
  A: To be frank, I consider them to be inefficient and annoying.

  **Q: Why are you using 'jkl;' keys instead of vim-like keys?**\
  A: Because it's the touch-typing standard I've used all my life.

  **Q: Why no bars?**\
  A: I usually find them distracting and they take up screen space.

  **Q: How portable is this setup?**\
  A: You may have some issues here, but I'll address this when possible.

  **Q: Have you tried other tiling window managers?**\
  A: Yes, but always came back to i3-wm; it just appeals to me the most.
