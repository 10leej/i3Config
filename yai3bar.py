# As you might have guessed, this is a work in very, very gradual progress. Very
# early days yet; just winging it at the moment, but ideas are forming.
#
# My desire for this is to just be written in Python (not relying on the slower, -
# shell) and for it to have a much, much faster refresh rate than the likes of
# i3blocks. I love i3blocks and used it for ages, but it has the odd drawback.
#
# It'll be a semi-personalized Python program to tack onto i3bar. No messy json!
# I'd also like it to be more involved, with notifications using notify2 based on
# events relative to the data processed here.
